My name is Alison, and I’m a senior at UCLA majoring in Statistics & Data Science and Economics. Originally from Hong Kong, I’ve had the opportunity to intern in diverse fields, including fixed income and consulting, which have shaped my analytical and problem-solving skills. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and hiking, activities that help me unwind and explore my creative side.
